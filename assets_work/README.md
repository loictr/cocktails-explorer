Tto produce the logos and icons:

1. generate the first image with comfyui with a white  background color
2. in photopea, crop the image
3. in photopea, use `image > adjustments > curves` and saturate the upper values to make all near-white colors to white
4. in photopea, use `filters > others > color to alpha` and select the white
5. export to png
